# lightning_tuna
Second iteration of my pytorch template for deep learning experiments. 
The main difference here is that I use `pytorch_lightning` to improve the 
clarity and structure of my code

## TODO:
1. clean environment.yml to be more readable
2. clean paths (done?)
3. add the tqdm 'progress_bar' option to the training steps (and val and test)
4. add accuracy score metrics (sklearn)
